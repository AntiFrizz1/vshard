## Compatibility

VShard 0.1.21 is fully compatible with the previous VShard versions.

## Bugs fixed

* Fixed a bug that the rebalancing didn't work if the sharded spaces had
  unusual types like 'varbinary' (gh-327, gh-328).

* A pack of fixes for problems with accessing buckets on replicas. They were not
  properly protected against rebalancer and users could read too outdated data
  or even inconsistent data (gh-173).

* Fixed a bug that if vshard's connection netbox fibers were killed on router or
  storage, the connection could be not re-established on some Tarantool versions
  making the peer inaccessible from the given node at all (gh-341).
